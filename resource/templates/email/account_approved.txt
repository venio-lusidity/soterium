Thank you for your request for an Soterium User Account. Your account has been activated and you now have access into the Soterium application. As a reminder, please ensure you are using Google Chrome as your Internet browser to access Soterium.

Lastly, there is a 30-day account activity limit. What this means is that if you do not access Soterium at least once every 30-days, your account will automatically be deactivated (not deleted). While there are reminders sent to you by Soterium before this occurs, please do not rely on this. If your account should be deactivated, please reach out to the Soterium.  After a short review of the situation, your account can be reactivated without any additional paperwork requirements.

We look forward to providing you a very insightful and informative perspective. Should you have any questions or concerns, please note that in that same banner area on the far-right side, there is a “Feedback” icon that goes out to the entire Soterium Admin Team. Please let us know if you have any questions or suggestions that are not covered in the User Guide.

Most Sincerely,

The Soterium Team
